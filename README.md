# GroupChatbot

## Proposer
 Hyunsik Lee

## Project Goal
A group chatbot system with variety of characteristics


## Motivation
There are many chatbot systems, but they are not flexible in dealing with various situations. Besides, they canâ€™t respond to every question because they are built on a rule/knowledge basis. I would suggest creating a machine learning-based group chatbot system which can answer to every question from their own perspectives, and user can decide final decision with the various comments.

## Main difference from existing product/solutions
-	Improved natural language processing ability through new neural network models such as transformer model
-	Characteristic various models
